# Ezra’s Work — Identity & Access Management Portfolio
Ezra’s Work — Identity & Access Management Portfolio
This repository powers ezras.work, my personal portfolio focused on identity governance, cloud security, and hands-on Microsoft Entra projects. It contains the source files, artifacts, and documentation that support my learning path toward IAM and cloud security roles.

## What you’ll find here
- Practical IAM labs built in Microsoft Entra
- Conditional Access and MFA enforcement examples
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) workflows
- Audit logs, sign-in telemetry, and governance evidence
- Reflections on real-world identity behavior
- Supporting documents and screenshots for each artifact

## Purpose
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and document identity and access management solutions using enterprise-grade tools. Each artifact includes real logs, real configurations, and clear explanations of the decisions behind them.
